        <br>
        <p>LG refrigerators are known for their quality, but like any appliance, they may encounter issues over time. Understanding when to call a technician is crucial to ensure your fridge operates efficiently. Below are common problems to watch for:</p>

           <h2>1. Temperature Fluctuations:</h2>
           <p>If you notice inconsistent cooling in the refrigerator or freezer compartments, it could indicate issues with the thermostat, sensors, or compressor. Call a technician if temperature problems persist.</p>

           <h2>2. Ice Maker Troubles:</h2>
           <p>Problems with ice production, overproduction, or issues with the ice dispenser may require professional attention. Technicians can assess and repair the ice maker components effectively.</p>

           <h2>3. Water Leakage:</h2>
           <p>Water pooling inside or around the refrigerator may signal problems with the defrost system, water inlet valve, or clogged drain. A technician can identify and fix the root cause of the leakage.</p>

           <h2>4. Unusual Noises:</h2>
           <p>If your LG refrigerator starts making strange sounds like buzzing, clicking, or rattling, it could indicate issues with the compressor, fan motors, or other internal components. Professional diagnosis is recommended.</p>

           <h2>5. Faulty Compressor:</h2>
           <p>A malfunctioning compressor can lead to temperature control problems and inadequate cooling. If you notice your fridge not maintaining the desired temperature, it's time to call a technician.</p>

           <h2>6. Door Seal Damage:</h2>
           <p>A compromised door gasket can affect the efficiency of your refrigerator. If you observe visible damage or feel cool air escaping, a technician can replace the door seal promptly.</p>

           <h2>7. Refrigerator Not Running:</h2>
           <p>If your LG fridge fails to turn on or experiences frequent power interruptions, it requires immediate attention. A technician can diagnose and address electrical issues affecting the appliance's operation.</p>

           <h2>When to Call a Technician:</h2>
           <ul>
               <li>**Persistent Issues:** If problems persist despite basic troubleshooting, it's time to seek professional help.</li>
               <li>**Electrical or Component Failure:** For issues related to electrical components or critical parts like the compressor, a technician's expertise is essential.</li>
               <li>**Warranty Concerns:** If your refrigerator is still under warranty, calling a certified technician ensures that repairs are covered and performed according to manufacturer standards.</li>
               <li>**Safety Concerns:** If you notice any issues that may pose safety risks, such as strange odors or smoke, contact a technician immediately.</li>
           </ul>
